Sentiment Analysis of Twitter data using a combined CNN-LSTM Neural Network model

### Motivation
This project seeks to extend the work we did previously on sentiment analysis using simple Feed-Foward Neural Networks (Found here: [paper](https://www.academia.edu/30498927/Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis_with_Neural_Networks) & [repo](https://github.com/pmsosa/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis)).
Instead, we wish to experiment with building a combined CNN-LSTM Neural Net model using Tensorflow.

### Dependencies
```
sudo -H pip install tensorflow
```
